# Webpack

Create a simple html having 2 buttons.
On click of each button, two different functions are performed. Each of these functions is present in separate js files.
Also create a css file inorder to style your html page.
Using Webpack, illustrate the concept of bundling - bundle all your files together in a single js file i.e. bundle.js
